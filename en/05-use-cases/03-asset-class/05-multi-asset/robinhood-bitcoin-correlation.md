![Robinhood and Bitcoin price relationship](../../../../assets/usecases/quick/RX-USECASE-0050/source-visuals.webp)

## What the research is trying to establish

Two price charts can rise in the same general direction without being tightly linked day to day. A high correlation in price **levels** can also be inflated when both assets simply share a long-term trend.

The research therefore proceeds in four steps:

1. compare major peaks, troughs, and sharp-move dates over the prior year;
2. compare price-level correlation with daily-return correlation;
3. identify periods when HOOD and Bitcoin diverged;
4. ask what economic mechanism could explain both the correlation and the breakdowns.

That separates **visual co-movement → quantitative correlation → exceptions → economic interpretation**.

## Market snapshot: August 2025 to August 2026

| Episode | Timing | HOOD | Bitcoin | Direction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Starting point | late Aug 2025 | ~108 | ~110,000 |: |
| Peak | early Oct 2025 | ~150 | ~124,800 | both near highs |
| Sharp selloff | early Feb 2026 | 72 | ~63,300 | both fell sharply |
| Secondary low | Jun 2026 | ~93 | ~58,500 | partial divergence |
| Recent rebound | 2026-08-21 | 108 | ~78,400 | both rebounded sharply |

The QUICK-provided research described a strong positive relationship over the period. It estimated price-level correlation at roughly **+0.8**, with daily-return correlation in the **+0.5 to +0.6** range.

## Why levels and returns should be separated

A high level correlation may reflect two assets trending upward over a long horizon.

Daily-return correlation asks a harder question: **do the assets actually move together from one day to the next?**

Using both helps distinguish a shared long-term trend from shorter-horizon co-movement.

## The divergence matters as much as the correlation

The source highlighted June 2026 as an example in which Bitcoin continued lower while HOOD recovered toward roughly 105–108.

That matters because it shows that HOOD is not simply a Bitcoin proxy. Company-specific factors such as earnings, trading activity, business mix, or guidance can dominate the crypto relationship for periods of time.

## Economic interpretation

The source linked the relationship to two channels:

- Robinhood's exposure to crypto trading activity means Bitcoin conditions can affect expectations for transaction revenue and engagement.
- Both HOOD and Bitcoin can behave like higher-beta risk assets and therefore respond to common macro drivers such as rates and risk appetite.

Neither channel implies a permanent one-for-one relationship.

## How to use the result

Do not treat a high correlation as proof that HOOD should always be traded as a Bitcoin proxy.

Instead, monitor when the relationship is stable and when it breaks. Useful follow-up variables include:

- crypto trading volumes;
- Robinhood earnings and guidance;
- changes in business mix;
- interest rates and broader risk appetite.

## Caveats

- Correlation estimates in the source are approximate.
- Correlation is sample- and horizon-dependent.
- A common macro driver can raise correlation without implying direct causality.

## What this use case demonstrates

This workflow moves from apparent cross-asset co-movement to return-based correlation, then actively searches for the periods that break the relationship.
