## Prompt used

The approved source does not specify the exact prompt used.

## When this workflow is useful

An earnings calendar can be used simply to check when a company reports. When several large retailers report within a few days, however, the group can also provide an early read on **the direction of US consumer spending**.

The workflow is:

**earnings calendar → pre-earnings questions → reported results / management commentary → patterns across retailers → macro and market-sentiment implications.**

It starts with the event screen, uses previews to define what matters before the release, uses reviews after the release, and then asks whether several retailers are describing the same change in consumer behavior.

## Retail earnings calendar

The source lists the following Japan-time events for that week:

- Home Depot: Aug. 18, 19:00 JST
- Target: Aug. 19, 19:30 JST
- Walmart: Aug. 20, 20:02 JST
- Ross: Aug. 21, 05:00 JST

The platform workflow opens the **Events** view to see companies reporting on each date.

## Change the questions before and after the release

### Before earnings

Use the earnings preview to identify:

- consensus expectations;
- important KPIs;
- prior guidance;
- the issues most likely to drive a surprise.

### After earnings

Use the earnings review to compare:

- actual results with expectations;
- guidance changes;
- management commentary;
- the market's immediate reaction.

Separating pre-event expectations from post-event evidence helps answer **what was already expected and what was genuinely new** rather than labeling results simply “good” or “bad.”

## Next question: can retail earnings inform the broader market view?

The QUICK source then asks Alfred whether US retail earnings can become a read on economic sentiment and influence the broader equity market.

The reason to move from the company calendar to this question is to separate **company-specific execution** from a broader shift in household behavior.

## Why retail earnings can act as a macro signal

### Consumer spending is central to the US economy

Retail sales, traffic, average ticket, and management commentary can provide timely evidence about household demand. The source notes that these company observations can complement official retail-sales data.

### Management commentary adds behavioral detail

Comments on trade-down behavior, discretionary versus essential categories, promotions, inventory, and guidance can reveal changes that are not visible in headline revenue alone.

### Several retailers can create a cross-company signal

A weak result at one company may reflect inventory management, merchandising, or another firm-specific problem. If several retailers report the same decline in traffic, shift toward lower-price products, or cautious outlook, the case for a broader consumer trend becomes stronger.

## Potential market transmission

- **Strong earnings and guidance:** can reinforce a resilient-consumer interpretation and support risk appetite.
- **Weak earnings and cautious guidance:** can increase concerns about consumer slowdown and pressure cyclical exposures.

The source also notes that the broader equity response still depends on monetary policy, inflation, employment, geopolitical risk, and other macro variables.

## How to use the workflow

During a retail earnings week, compare companies side by side on:

- sales;
- traffic;
- average ticket;
- inventories;
- promotions / discounting;
- guidance;
- management's description of the consumer.

The goal is to move from isolated stock reactions to a cross-company view of the consumer while keeping company-specific explanations separate.

## What this use case demonstrates

This example links an event calendar to pre-event preparation, post-event review, cross-company pattern detection, and finally a broader consumer / market-sentiment question.
