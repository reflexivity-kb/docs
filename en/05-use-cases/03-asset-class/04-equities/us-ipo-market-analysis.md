![US IPO market: completed deals and forward pipeline](../../../../assets/usecases/quick/RX-USECASE-0048/source-visuals.webp)

## Research objective

IPO-market strength cannot be judged from aggregate proceeds alone. One exceptionally large deal can dominate total issuance, while weak aftermarket performance can reveal that investors are still highly selective.

The source therefore separates four questions:

**completed issuance → aftermarket selection → forward supply pipeline → broader capital-allocation impact.**

It first checks deal size, first-day reaction, and subsequent return for completed offerings. Only after observing realized investor demand does it turn to future candidates and ask how much additional capital and attention the pipeline could absorb.

## Completed deals

The source characterizes 2026 as historically large by aggregate US IPO proceeds, while emphasizing that the total was heavily influenced by one very large transaction and that aftermarket performance was mixed.

| Company | Ticker | Pricing date | Proceeds in source ($M) | Offer price | First open vs offer | Return vs offer in source |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| SpaceX | SPCX | 2026-06-11 | 75,000 | $135 | +19.2% | +9.3% |
| SK hynix, US listing | SKHY | 2026-07-09 | 26,507 | $149 | +12.8% | +24.5% |
| INNIO Holding | INIO | 2026-06-03 | 2,430 | $27 | +14.8% | - |
| Bending Spoons | BSP | 2026-06-30 | 1,681 | $29 | +39.7% | +34.8% |
| Quantinuum | QNT | 2026-06-03 | 1,680 | $60 | +0.6% | -18.5% |
| Doncasters | DPC | 2026-06-24 | 919 | $33 | +33.3% | - |
| Parabilis Medicines | PBLS | 2026-06-09 | 670 | $20 | +66.8% | - |

### What the completed-deal data shows

- **Large proceeds do not equal uniformly strong aftermarket performance.** The source uses SpaceX as the clearest example: very large issuance and a positive return versus offer price, but weaker performance from the initial trading level.
- **Investor selection remains important.** The source contrasts weaker Quantinuum performance with stronger Bending Spoons and the US-listed SK hynix exposure.
- **Issuance was concentrated in large themes.** Space, AI, semiconductors, and related growth areas received a disproportionate share of attention and capital.
- The source also notes a high count of SPAC-related issuance relative to conventional operating-company IPOs.

## Forward pipeline

The next step is not to assume that reported candidates will actually list. It is to map the potential supply and ask what would happen if several large deals compete for investor capital in a short period.

| Candidate in source | Sector | Source timing | Source scale / observation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anthropic | AI | Late October 2026 reported/observed | Described as a potentially record-scale transaction; source cites prediction-market estimates |
| OpenAI | AI | Reporting leaned toward 2027 | Source cites a confidential-filing report and wide size estimates |
| Nscale | AI infrastructure | Targeting year-end in source | Source cites bank appointments and a large private valuation |
| SB Energy | Energy infrastructure | Year-end candidate | Source connects the story to data-center electricity demand |
| Other candidates | Fintech / consumer | Year-end candidates | Ramp, Oura, Inspire Brands and others cited in source reporting |

All of these items are explicitly **reported or observed pipeline candidates from the source date**, not guarantees of an IPO or of the cited timing or size.

## Why the pipeline matters

A large IPO does not only affect its own stock. Several large offerings close together can:

- absorb investor cash and attention;
- shift demand among other new issues;
- affect allocation to already-listed growth stocks;
- create sector crowding if many deals share the same AI or infrastructure narrative;
- increase sensitivity to rates and risk appetite during the marketing window.

The source therefore treats “deal-calendar congestion” as a market-liquidity question rather than only an IPO-company question.

## How to use the workflow

A useful IPO-market dashboard should keep four separate views:

1. **proceeds concentration**: how much aggregate issuance depends on a few mega-deals;
2. **aftermarket return**: whether buyers are actually being rewarded after listing;
3. **sector concentration**: where capital is clustering;
4. **future supply**: how much new equity could arrive next and compete for capital.

The next update should also examine lock-up expirations, rates, and flows into growth equities, because those can change the market impact even if the forward IPO calendar itself is unchanged.

## Limitations

- Future IPO candidates, timing, and valuation estimates are based on reporting or market expectations in the source and can change.
- Some post-listing return histories were only a few weeks or months long.
- The source notes that SK hynix's US listing differs in nature from a conventional new-company IPO.
- Aggregate issuance can be distorted by unusually large deals.

## Research basis

The QUICK research combined listed-market time series, IPO reporting, prediction-market information, and IPO statistics.

## What this use case demonstrates

This example treats the IPO market as a supply-and-demand system: assess realized deal quality first, then the forward pipeline, and finally the effect of issuance concentration on broader capital allocation.
