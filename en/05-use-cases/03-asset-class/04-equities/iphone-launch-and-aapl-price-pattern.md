## Research objective

A single post-launch price move does not tell us whether the reaction is typical for Apple product events or specific to the current announcement.

The source therefore follows four steps:

**historical event pattern → current reaction → factors explaining the difference → next evidence to monitor.**

It first separates launch-day behavior from the following weeks or quarter. That creates a baseline before asking whether the latest event is genuinely unusual.

## Historical pattern

| Year | Launch event | Before event | Immediate reaction | Following weeks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2021, iPhone 13 | Sep. 14 | Sep. 9: 154.07 | Sep. 14: 148.12 → Sep. 16: 148.79 | Soft initially, then rose toward the 179 area by year-end |
| 2022, iPhone 14 | Sep. 7 | Sep. 1: 157.96 | Sep. 7: 155.96 → Sep. 9: 157.37 | Weakened later amid that year's macro backdrop |
| 2023, iPhone 15 | Sep. 12 | Sep. 5: 189.70 | Sep. 12: 176.30 → Sep. 14: 175.74 | Clear weakness around the event |
| 2024, iPhone 16 | Sep. 9 | Sep. 5: 222.38 | Sep. 9: 220.91 → Sep. 12: 222.77 | Sideways, then recovered toward 233 by month-end |
| 2025, iPhone 17 | Sep. 9 | Sep. 9: 234.35 | Sep. 11: 230.03 | Initial decline followed by a rebound above 254 by Sep. 23 |
| 2026, iPhone Duo / 18 | Sep. 9 | Sep. 4: 319.97 | Sep. 9: about -0.3%; Sep. 10: +2.4% to 326.57 | Source describes an upward post-event tone |

The source identifies a recurring **“sell the news” or muted launch-day reaction**, followed in several years by improvement over the following weeks as investors shift attention from the announcement itself to sales, shipments, and earnings evidence.

It also notes that 2022 was heavily affected by the broader macro environment, which is a reminder not to attribute every post-launch move to the product event.

## Why the latest reaction looked different

The source says the announcement day itself was almost flat, but AAPL rose about **2.4% the following day**. Because that was more positive than the typical immediate pattern, the research asks what was different rather than simply labeling the event a success.

### Pricing

The source describes the new foldable iPhone Duo at a starting price of **$1,999**, below the investor expectations cited in the source and closer to competing premium foldable devices.

Analyst commentary cited by the source interpreted the pricing as a decision to prioritize adoption and unit volume rather than maximize near-term margin per device.

### Demand expectations

The source cites optimistic replacement-cycle and shipment expectations as support for the positive reaction.

### Counterevidence: margin pressure and supply constraints

The research also tests the positive interpretation against two risks:

- **Gross-margin pressure:** lower-than-feared pricing could support unit demand while still creating margin pressure if component costs remain high.
- **Supply constraints:** the source cites concern that meaningful foldable-device shipments could arrive later, limiting near-term earnings contribution.

This matters because a positive share-price reaction to pricing does not automatically imply a positive profit outcome.

## Conclusion

The source sees the latest event as partly consistent with history - launch-day reaction remained muted - but unusual in the strength of the next-day buying response.

It attributes that difference primarily to the pricing strategy and demand expectations, while identifying **initial sales, shipment data, and margin impact** as the next evidence needed to test the thesis.

## How to use the workflow

For recurring corporate events, avoid judging success or failure from the event-day return alone.

1. build a historical event baseline;
2. separate immediate reaction from subsequent performance;
3. identify what is genuinely different this time;
4. test the positive interpretation against supply, margin, and company-specific risks;
5. update the view when real operating data arrive.

## Research basis

- Entity: AAPL:NASD
- Time series: AAPL:NASD.price
- The QUICK source also referenced product-launch reporting, analyst commentary, pricing information, and market-reaction news.

## What this use case demonstrates

This example uses repeated corporate events as a historical control set, compares the current reaction with that baseline, tests the difference against competing explanations, and identifies the operating data needed for the next update.
