> This is a dated workflow example.

The source demonstrates using Market Catalyst to review major news analysis, with the Federal Reserve Beige Book as the example event.

## Prompt used

The approved source does not specify the exact prompt used.

## When this workflow is useful

A document such as the Beige Book contains a large amount of information. In many investment workflows, the first task is not to read the entire document line by line. It is to identify **which points are most likely to matter for markets**, then decide which region or theme deserves deeper work.

Market Catalyst provides an entry point from the event headline into the analysis. The workflow narrows the feed to the user's coverage area, identifies the relevant event, and then opens the detailed market interpretation.

## Workflow

If no country, region, or theme has been configured, the Market Catalyst view may appear blank. The source suggests:

1. open **Insights** and select **Market Catalyst**;
2. configure the relevant theme, country, or region: one filter is sufficient;
3. select an important event such as the Beige Book from the resulting list;
4. open the event to review key points and market implications.

The reason to configure the coverage area first is not to read fewer headlines for its own sake. It is to prioritize the events most relevant to the portfolio or research mandate.

The resulting research flow is:

**coverage filter → market-relevant event → key points → deeper research target.**

## How to use the result

The value is not only a shorter Beige Book summary. The workflow helps answer **what should I investigate next?**

For example, after identifying a market-relevant Beige Book point, the analyst can move into the region, sector, inflation, labor, or policy issue most relevant to the portfolio rather than treating the entire document as equally important.

## What this use case demonstrates

This is a workflow example for moving from a broad information source into a prioritized research path: configure the relevant coverage, identify the important catalyst, read the analysis, and use it to select the next question.
