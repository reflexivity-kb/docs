> This is a dated scenario analysis, not a current prediction. The Federal Reserve's official calendar confirms the September 15–16, 2026 FOMC meeting and Kevin Warsh as FOMC Chairman; probability estimates and macro readings below remain source-date snapshots.

## Prompt used
> [!IMPORTANT]
> What could Chairman Kevin Warsh say about a possible rate increase at this week's FOMC, given inflation, the oil-price rise, and the broader macro backdrop?
![FOMC rate-hike scenario analysis](../../../../assets/usecases/quick/RX-USECASE-0041/source-visuals.webp)

## Research objective

Ahead of an FOMC meeting, it is easy to focus only on **hike versus hold**. Market reaction, however, depends both on the policy decision and on how the Chair explains the reaction function from here. An outcome that is already heavily priced can also produce a limited reaction even when it occurs.

The workflow therefore moves through four layers:

**macro constraints → market pricing → policy scenarios → communication tone.**

It first checks inflation, oil, labor, and the current policy rate; then asks what the market has already priced; then lays out base, hold, and dovish alternatives together with the conditions that would support each one.

## Macro snapshot at the time

| Indicator | Source value | Source date | Policy interpretation in source |
|---|---:|---|---|
| WTI crude | $100.05/bbl | 2026-09-11 | YTD +74.5%; supply-side inflation pressure |
| CPI YoY | 3.4% | 2026-09-11 | Above 2% target and reaccelerating |
| Core PCE YoY | 3.3% | 2026-08-26 | Underlying inflation still elevated |
| Unemployment rate | 4.1% | 2026-09-04 | Labor market viewed as resilient |
| Policy rate | 3.75% | 2026-07 | Source frames policy as moving back toward tightening |

The source describes Warsh as prioritizing inflation control and being reluctant to use extensive forward guidance. Rather than treat that characterization alone as the forecast, the analysis asks whether incoming data and market pricing support it.

## Scenario map

| Scenario | Source market probability | Policy action | Communication pattern assumed in the source |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Hawkish base case | ~87.5% | +25 bp, 3.75% → 4.00% | Emphasize inflation control and the 2% objective; highlight oil and core inflation; stay data-dependent |
| Hold with hawkish bias | ~12.5% | Hold at 3.75% | Skip a hike now but preserve the option to tighten later |
| Dovish / cut | <1% | Cut | Would require an unexpected shock such as rapid labor-market deterioration |

The point of the scenario table is not to accept the 87.5% estimate as a durable fact. It is to make explicit **what would have to be true for the less-likely outcomes to occur**.

## How to use the workflow

Immediately before the meeting, update four inputs:

1. oil and other inflation-sensitive commodity prices;
2. inflation data;
3. labor-market data;
4. the market-implied policy distribution.

After the meeting, compare both the decision and the Chair's emphasis with the pre-defined scenarios. Which variable did the Chair foreground - inflation, oil, labor, or another risk - and which market repriced first: rates, FX, or broader risk assets?

That turns a meeting preview into a repeatable pre/post-event research process rather than a one-point forecast.

## Limitations

- Scenario probabilities are dated estimates from the source, not confirmed outcomes.
- The source corrected an apparent typo and interpreted a phrase as referring to crude oil / raw-material price increases.
- Characterization of the Chair's stance relies partly on reporting and speech coverage.
- The source's policy-rate series was last updated at 3.75% for July 2026.

## What this use case demonstrates

This example shows how to organize event risk around the macro constraints, what is already priced, alternative policy paths, and the communication that would validate or invalidate each path.
